# üîí Security Architecture Guide

## Overview

This guide explains the three-tier security system implemented to protect user funds:

1. **User Wallet Connection** - Non-custodial wallet integration
2. **Withdrawal Approval System** - Admin-controlled withdrawal queue
3. **Multi-Signature Wallets** - Distributed signing authority

---

## üîë User Wallet Connection (Non-Custodial)

### What It Is
Users connect their existing Solana wallets (Phantom, Solflare, etc.) to the bot. The bot **never** stores private keys - users sign transactions in their own wallets.

### How It Works

#### 1. Connection Process
```
User runs /connectwallet
  ‚Üì
Bot generates challenge message
  ‚Üì
User signs message in their wallet
  ‚Üì
User submits signature with /verifywallet
  ‚Üì
Bot verifies signature cryptographically
  ‚Üì
‚úÖ Wallet connected (stored: userId ‚Üí walletAddress)
```

#### 2. Transaction Flow
```
User wants to tip/withdraw
  ‚Üì
Bot creates unsigned transaction
  ‚Üì
Bot sends transaction data to user
  ‚Üì
User signs in their wallet
  ‚Üì
User submits signed transaction to bot
  ‚Üì
‚úÖ Bot broadcasts to Solana network
```

### Commands

**`/connectwallet`**
- Generates a challenge message for signing
- Returns session ID and message to sign
- Expires in 5 minutes

**`/verifywallet <session> <wallet> <signature>`**
- Verifies signature using nacl.sign.detached.verify
- Links Discord user ID to wallet address
- Stores connection in MongoDB

**`/disconnectwallet`**
- Removes wallet connection
- User must reconnect to use bot

### Database Schema
```javascript
{
  userId: "Discord user ID",
  walletAddress: "Solana public key",
  connectedAt: Date,
  lastUsed: Date,
  verified: true
}
```

### Security Benefits
‚úÖ Bot never has access to private keys
‚úÖ Users maintain full custody of funds
‚úÖ Every transaction requires explicit user approval
‚úÖ Transparent on-chain verification

---

## ‚è≥ Withdrawal Approval System

### What It Is
A queue-based system where withdrawals above a threshold require admin approval before processing.

### Configuration
```javascript
AUTO_APPROVE_THRESHOLD = 0.1 SOL  // Withdrawals under this: instant
PENDING_TIMEOUT = 24 hours         // Requests expire after this
```

### How It Works

#### Small Withdrawals (< 0.1 SOL)
```
User: /withdraw 0.05 SOL
  ‚Üì
‚úÖ Auto-approved instantly
  ‚Üì
Transaction processed immediately
```

#### Large Withdrawals (‚â• 0.1 SOL)
```
User: /withdraw 1.0 SOL
  ‚Üì
‚è≥ Enters approval queue
  ‚Üì
Admin reviews with /pending
  ‚Üì
Admin: /approve <id>  OR  /reject <id> <reason>
  ‚Üì
‚úÖ Transaction processed  OR  ‚ùå Request rejected
```

### Commands

**`/withdraw <address> <amount> <currency>`** (User)
- Requests a withdrawal
- Auto-approves if under threshold
- Otherwise enters pending queue

**`/pending`** (Admin Only)
- Lists all pending withdrawal requests
- Shows user, amount, address, timestamp

**`/approve <withdrawal_id>`** (Admin Only)
- Approves and processes withdrawal
- Logs admin action in audit trail
- Notifies user

**`/reject <withdrawal_id> <reason>`** (Admin Only)
- Rejects withdrawal request
- Logs rejection reason
- Notifies user with reason

### Database Schema

**withdrawalQueue Collection**
```javascript
{
  id: "WD1640123456ABC",
  userId: "Discord user ID",
  username: "Discord username",
  toAddress: "Destination wallet",
  amount: 1000000000,  // lamports
  currency: "SOL",
  status: "PENDING | AUTO_APPROVED | COMPLETED | REJECTED | EXPIRED | FAILED",
  requestedAt: Date,
  expiresAt: Date,
  approvedBy: "Admin user ID",
  approvedAt: Date,
  rejectedBy: "Admin user ID",
  rejectedAt: Date,
  rejectionReason: "String",
  txSignature: "Solana tx hash"
}
```

**auditLog Collection**
```javascript
{
  action: "WITHDRAWAL_REQUESTED | WITHDRAWAL_APPROVED | WITHDRAWAL_REJECTED",
  userId: "User ID",
  adminId: "Admin ID (if applicable)",
  withdrawalId: "WD1640123456ABC",
  amount: 1000000000,
  currency: "SOL",
  timestamp: Date,
  txSignature: "Solana tx hash (if completed)"
}
```

### Security Benefits
‚úÖ Prevents unauthorized large withdrawals
‚úÖ Admin oversight for high-value transactions
‚úÖ Complete audit trail of all actions
‚úÖ Time-limited requests prevent stale approvals
‚úÖ Automatic cleanup of expired requests

## üîê Multi-Signature Wallets

### What It Is
Uses [Squads Protocol](https://squads.so/) to create wallets requiring M-of-N signatures for transactions.

Example: 2-of-3 wallet needs 2 out of 3 authorized signers to approve any transaction.

### How It Works

#### 1. Create Multi-Sig Wallet
```
Admin: /multisig-create
  signers: Alice, Bob, Charlie
  threshold: 2
  ‚Üì
‚úÖ 2-of-3 wallet created on Squads
```

#### 2. Create Transaction Proposal
```
Alice: /multisig-propose
  multisig: <wallet_address>
  recipient: <destination>
  amount: 10 SOL
  ‚Üì
üìù Proposal created (1/2 approvals)
```

#### 3. Approve Proposal
```
Bob: /multisig-approve <proposal_id>
  ‚Üì
‚úÖ 2/2 approvals met
  ‚Üì
üöÄ Transaction automatically executed on-chain
```

#### 4. Or Reject Proposal
```
Charlie: /multisig-reject <proposal_id> <reason>
  ‚Üì
‚ùå Proposal rejected
```

### Commands

**`/multisig-create <signers> <threshold>`** (Admin Only)
- Creates new multi-sig wallet via Squads
- `signers`: Comma-separated wallet addresses
- `threshold`: Required number of approvals
- Returns multi-sig wallet address

**`/multisig-propose <multisig> <recipient> <amount> <currency>`** (Signer Only)
- Creates transaction proposal
- Proposer automatically approves (counts as 1)
- Expires after 7 days

**`/multisig-approve <proposal_id> <signer_wallet>`** (Signer Only)
- Adds approval to proposal
- Auto-executes when threshold met
- Verifies signer is authorized

**`/multisig-reject <proposal_id> <reason>`** (Signer Only)
- Rejects proposal with reason
- Proposal cannot be executed after rejection

### Database Schema

**multiSigWallets Collection**
```javascript
{
  address: "Multi-sig wallet address",
  signers: ["Alice wallet", "Bob wallet", "Charlie wallet"],
  threshold: 2,
  createdAt: Date,
  active: true
}
```

**multiSigProposals Collection**
```javascript
{
  id: "PROP1640123456XYZ",
  multisigAddress: "Multi-sig wallet",
  proposerId: "Discord user ID",
  transactionData: {
    recipient: "Destination wallet",
    amount: 10000000000,  // lamports
    currency: "SOL"
  },
  status: "PENDING | APPROVED | EXECUTED | REJECTED | EXPIRED | FAILED",
  approvals: ["userId1", "userId2"],
  rejections: [],
  requiredApprovals: 2,
  createdAt: Date,
  expiresAt: Date,
  executedAt: Date,
  txSignature: "Solana tx hash"
}
```

### Security Benefits
‚úÖ No single point of failure
‚úÖ Requires consensus for large transactions
‚úÖ Transparent approval process
‚úÖ On-chain verification via Squads
‚úÖ Time-limited proposals
‚úÖ Rejection veto power

## üöÄ Integration Guide

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install @sqds/sdk tweetnacl bs58
```

### Step 2: Initialize Managers
```javascript
const WalletConnectionManager = require('./src/security/walletConnection');
const WithdrawalQueue = require('./src/security/withdrawalQueue');
const MultiSigManager = require('./src/security/multiSig');
const SecureCommands = require('./src/commands/secureCommands');

// Initialize
const walletManager = new WalletConnectionManager(database);
const withdrawalQueue = new WithdrawalQueue(database, connection);
const multiSigManager = new MultiSigManager(database, connection);
const commands = new SecureCommands(walletManager, withdrawalQueue, multiSigManager, database);
```

### Step 3: Register Commands
```javascript
// Register all secure commands
const commandBuilders = commands.getCommands();
client.commands.push(...commandBuilders);

// Register commands with Discord
await client.application.commands.set(commandBuilders);
```

### Step 4: Handle Interactions
```javascript
client.on('interactionCreate', async interaction => {
  if (!interaction.isCommand()) return;

  switch (interaction.commandName) {
    case 'connectwallet':
      await commands.connectWallet(interaction);
      break;
    case 'verifywallet':
      await commands.verifyWallet(
        interaction,
        interaction.options.getString('session'),
        interaction.options.getString('wallet'),
        interaction.options.getString('signature')
      );
      break;
    case 'withdraw':
      await commands.requestWithdrawal(
        interaction,
        interaction.options.getString('address'),
        interaction.options.getNumber('amount'),
        interaction.options.getString('currency')
      );
      break;
    case 'approve':
      await commands.approveWithdrawal(
        interaction,
        interaction.options.getString('id')
      );
      break;
    // ... other commands
  }
});
```

### Step 5: Set Up Cleanup Tasks
```javascript
// Clean up expired sessions/requests every hour
setInterval(async () => {
  walletManager.cleanupExpired();
  await withdrawalQueue.cleanupExpired();
  await multiSigManager.cleanupExpired();
}, 60 * 60 * 1000);
```

### Step 6: Configure Admin Access
```env
ADMIN_USER_IDS=1153034319271559328,987654321098765432
SUPER_ADMIN_USER_IDS=1153034319271559328
```

## üìä Monitoring & Auditing

### Audit Log Events
All security-sensitive actions are logged:

- `WALLET_CONNECTED` - User connects wallet
- `WALLET_DISCONNECTED` - User disconnects wallet
- `WITHDRAWAL_REQUESTED` - Withdrawal request created
- `WITHDRAWAL_APPROVED` - Admin approves withdrawal
- `WITHDRAWAL_REJECTED` - Admin rejects withdrawal
- `MULTISIG_CREATED` - New multi-sig wallet created
- `MULTISIG_PROPOSAL_CREATED` - Transaction proposal created
- `MULTISIG_PROPOSAL_APPROVED` - Proposal approved
- `MULTISIG_PROPOSAL_REJECTED` - Proposal rejected

### Query Audit Logs
```javascript
// Get all actions by user
await db.collection('auditLog').find({ userId: "123" }).toArray();

// Get all withdrawal approvals
await db.collection('auditLog').find({ action: "WITHDRAWAL_APPROVED" }).toArray();

// Get actions in date range
await db.collection('auditLog').find({
  timestamp: {
    $gte: new Date('2025-01-01'),
    $lte: new Date('2025-01-31')
  }
}).toArray();
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations

### What This Solves
‚úÖ Private key custody (users keep their own keys)
‚úÖ Unauthorized withdrawals (admin approval required)
‚úÖ Single point of failure (multi-sig distribution)
‚úÖ Lack of accountability (complete audit trail)

### What This Doesn't Solve
‚ùå User device security (if user's wallet is compromised)
‚ùå Admin account compromise (secure admin Discord accounts with 2FA)
‚ùå Smart contract bugs (audit Squads Protocol separately)
‚ùå Network attacks (use trusted RPC endpoints)

### Best Practices

1. **Admin Access Control**
   - Use 2FA on all admin Discord accounts
   - Limit number of admins
   - Regularly rotate admin list

2. **Threshold Configuration**
   - Start with low auto-approval threshold (0.1 SOL)
   - Increase based on usage patterns
   - Monitor for unusual activity

3. **Multi-Sig Setup**
   - Use 2-of-3 or 3-of-5 for production
   - Store signer keys in different locations
   - Test proposal flow before going live

4. **Monitoring**
   - Set up alerts for large withdrawal requests
   - Review audit logs weekly
   - Monitor proposal approval patterns

5. **User Education**
   - Explain non-custodial model clearly
   - Warn users about wallet security
   - Provide clear instructions for signing

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Invalid signature" error
- Check that user signed exact challenge message
- Verify wallet address matches
- Ensure signature is base58 encoded
- Check session hasn't expired (5 minutes)

### "Withdrawal request not found"
- Verify withdrawal ID is correct
- Check if request expired (24 hours)
- Ensure request wasn't already processed

### "Cannot approve proposal"
- Verify user is authorized signer
- Check proposal hasn't expired (7 days)
- Ensure proposal is still PENDING status
- Verify signer wallet matches multi-sig signers

### "Multi-sig creation failed"
- Ensure Squads SDK is initialized
- Check signer addresses are valid
- Verify threshold ‚â§ number of signers
- Confirm sufficient SOL for rent

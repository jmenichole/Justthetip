# StakeStats.net Poll Questions - JustTheTip Bot Market Research

## Context
StakeStats.net Discord server has 10K members interested in Solana staking and crypto community engagement. This audience is perfect for testing JustTheTip bot features focused on community tipping, engagement, and monetization.

## Poll Strategy
- **Target**: 5-7 questions maximum (don't overwhelm)
- **Focus**: Feature validation, pain points, willingness to pay
- **Format**: Mix of multiple choice and rating scales
- **Goal**: Validate product-market fit and prioritize features

---

## Recommended Poll Questions

### Question 1: Current Tipping Behavior (Multiple Choice)
**"How often do you tip or reward other members in Discord servers?"**

- [ ] Multiple times per week (power user)
- [ ] Once a week (regular user)
- [ ] A few times per month (casual user)
- [ ] Rarely/Never (not interested)

**Why this matters**: Identifies your core users vs. potential converts. Power users = premium target, casual = freemium target.

---

### Question 2: Biggest Friction Point (Multiple Choice)
**"What stops you from tipping more often in Discord? (Select all that apply)"**

- [ ] Too complicated to set up wallets/transactions
- [ ] Fees are too high
- [ ] Don't trust bots with crypto
- [ ] No good reason/incentive to tip
- [ ] Worried about privacy (others seeing what I tip)
- [ ] Not sure who to tip or when
- [ ] Other (comment below)

**Why this matters**: Reveals exactly what features solve real problems. Privacy concerns = private tips are valuable. Complexity = natural language is valuable. High fees = fee-free premium is valuable.

---

### Question 3: Premium Feature Value (Rating Scale)
**"Would you pay $4.99/month for these premium features?"**
- Private tips (no public announcements)
- Zero transaction fees (bot covers costs)
- Advanced airdrop tools (reward active members automatically)
- Custom trivia games with prizes

Rate 1-5:
- 1 = Definitely not
- 2 = Probably not
- 3 = Maybe/Neutral
- 4 = Probably yes
- 5 = Definitely yes

**Why this matters**: Direct willingness-to-pay validation. Scores 4-5 = strong product-market fit. Scores 1-2 = price too high or features not compelling.

---

### Question 4: Most Exciting Feature (Ranked Choice)
**"Rank these features by what you'd use most (1 = most interested, 4 = least interested):"**

- Trivia games with crypto prizes (triviadrop)
- Natural language tipping ("send 5 SOL to @user" instead of commands)
- Automated reports (see who you've tipped, who tipped you, analytics)
- Community airdrops with smart targeting (reward active members only)

**Why this matters**: Prioritizes development. If triviadrop ranks #1, market that heavily. If natural language ranks low, deprioritize.

---

### Question 5: Engagement Incentive (Multiple Choice)
**"What would make you tip someone in your Discord community? (Select top 2)"**

- [ ] They helped me solve a problem
- [ ] They created great content (memes, guides, analysis)
- [ ] They're consistently active and engaged
- [ ] Special occasions (birthdays, milestones)
- [ ] They tipped me first (reciprocity)
- [ ] Random acts of kindness/fun
- [ ] To show appreciation to admins/mods

**Why this matters**: Informs marketing messaging and use cases. If "helped solve problem" wins, market as "reward helpers." If "reciprocity" wins, emphasize the social loop.

---

### Question 6: Trust & Security (Rating Scale)
**"How important is it that the bot NEVER holds your crypto (non-custodial)?"**

Rate 1-5:
- 1 = Don't care
- 2 = Slightly important
- 3 = Moderately important
- 4 = Very important
- 5 = Absolutely critical (dealbreaker if not)

**Why this matters**: Validates the non-custodial architecture as a selling point. If scores average 4-5, make this a primary marketing message.

---

### Question 7: Beta Tester Interest (Multiple Choice)
**"Would you be interested in beta testing a tipping bot with these features?"**

- [ ] Yes, I'd love to try it! (Share your Discord username below)
- [ ] Maybe, tell me more
- [ ] No, not interested
- [ ] I'd be interested if it was free to try

**Why this matters**: Builds your launch list. "Yes" responses = immediate beta testers. "Maybe" = nurture list. "If free" = freemium is important.

---

## Poll Execution Tips

### Format & Delivery
1. **Use Discord's poll feature** (native, easy to answer)
2. **Post in #general or #community** (max visibility)
3. **Pin for 3-5 days** (give people time to see it)
4. **Add context**: "Hey StakeStats fam! Building a new tipping bot for Solana communities. Need your feedback to make it awesome. Takes 2 minutes 🙏"

### Incentivize Participation
- **Offer airdrop**: "Everyone who completes the poll gets airdropped 0.1 SOL when we launch"
- **Show results**: "Will share results in 1 week and announce if we're building based on your feedback"
- **Tag influencers**: Ask StakeStats admins to vouch/encourage participation

### What NOT to Do
- ❌ Don't ask more than 7 questions (people will bail)
- ❌ Don't make it feel like a sales pitch (genuine curiosity only)
- ❌ Don't ask for emails/personal info (creepy and hurts response rate)
- ❌ Don't spam multiple channels (one poll, pinned)

## Recommended 5-Question Version (If You Want Shorter)

If you want to be extra respectful of people's time, use these 5:

1. **Question 2**: Biggest Friction Point (reveals pain points)
2. **Question 3**: Premium Feature Value (willingness to pay)
3. **Question 4**: Most Exciting Feature (feature prioritization)
4. **Question 5**: Engagement Incentive (use case validation)
5. **Question 7**: Beta Tester Interest (build launch list)

Skip Questions 1 and 6 - you can infer behavior from other answers and non-custodial is table stakes.

## After the Poll: Action Items

### High Engagement (200+ responses)
- **4+ average on Q3**: Launch with $4.99 premium pricing, validate PMF
- **3-3.5 average on Q3**: Consider $2.99 intro pricing or 30-day free trial
- **<3 average on Q3**: Freemium model, focus on ecosystem revenue

### Feature Prioritization
- **Triviadrop ranks #1**: Make it your hero feature, showcase in all marketing
- **Natural language ranks #1**: Lead with convenience, "tipping made simple"
- **Reports rank #1**: Market to power users, analytics-focused messaging

### Beta List Building
- **50+ beta signups**: You have enough for soft launch validation
- **20-50 beta signups**: Add incentive (early access perks)
- **<20 beta signups**: Poll might have missed the mark, or audience mismatch

## Expected Outcomes & Next Steps

### If Poll Shows Strong Interest (avg 4+ on Q3, 100+ responses)
✅ **Full speed ahead**: Launch beta in 2-4 weeks  
✅ **Price validation**: $4.99 premium is justified  
✅ **Feature prioritization**: Double down on top-ranked features  

### If Poll Shows Moderate Interest (avg 3-4 on Q3, 50-100 responses)
⚠️ **Soft launch**: Beta with 20-30 testers, iterate based on feedback  
⚠️ **Pricing adjustment**: Consider $2.99 or freemium-first approach  
⚠️ **Feature cuts**: Focus on top 2 ranked features only  

### If Poll Shows Low Interest (avg <3 on Q3, <50 responses)
🛑 **Pivot or reposition**: Wrong audience or wrong messaging  
🛑 **Free tier focus**: Build for volume, monetize via ecosystem referrals  
🛑 **Different community**: Test in gaming/creator communities instead  

---

## Bonus: Follow-Up Questions (If Initial Poll Succeeds)

If you get strong engagement on the first poll, you can run a **follow-up poll 2-3 weeks later** with:

1. "What's a fair price for private tips? (per tip)"
   - $0.01, $0.05, $0.10, Included in premium subscription

2. "Would you pay more for customization? (custom colors, vanity tags)"
   - Yes, up to $2.99 one-time, Yes up to $4.99 one-time, No

3. "Which partner feature would you use most?"
   - Easy fiat → SOL conversion (Coinbase), Faster transactions (Helius RPC), Swap directly in Discord (Jupiter)

But DON'T run these unless first poll gets 100+ responses. Otherwise you're wasting goodwill.

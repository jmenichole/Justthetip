✨ SHIPPED! @AllMightUS 

JustTheTip just went from MVP to production with a complete WalletConnect overhaul!

Before ❌:

• Manual wallet entry fallback

After ✅:
• Reown AppKit with QR codes
• 200+ Solana wallets supported
• Works seamlessly in Discord
• Desktop QR scanning

The difference between "it works on my machine" and "it works everywhere" 🌍

Final milestone complete - ready for review!

### Option 3: Journey/Story Focus
```
🏆 From prototype to production @AllMightUS 

Started: A Discord bot that forgets wallets on restart
Ended: A production Solana agent with enterprise-grade persistence

The journey:
• Day 1-3: Basic tip functionality
• Day 4-7: Wallet registration (in-memory)
• Day 8-12: SQLite database migration
• Day 13-15: Railway deployment chaos
• Day 16-18: iOS Universal Links attempt
• Day 19-21: WalletConnect v2 (wrong approach)
• Day 22-24: Reown AppKit integration ✅

Real developers ship, iterate, and ship again. 

Final tranche review ready! Let's close this out 💪

## 📋 Your Deployment Checklist

### Before Deploying

- [ ] Run `./setup-railway.sh` (generates keypair)
- [ ] Get Discord CLIENT_SECRET from Developer Portal
- [ ] Have MongoDB URI ready (already in .env)
- [ ] Fund mint wallet with 0.5-1 SOL

### During Deployment

- [ ] Create Railway/Render project
- [ ] Connect GitHub repository
- [ ] Add environment variables (see guide)
- [ ] Generate domain/URL
- [ ] Wait for deployment (2-3 minutes)

### After Deployment

- [ ] Test health endpoint: `curl https://your-url/api/health`
- [ ] Update `docs/landing-app.js` with API_BASE_URL
- [ ] Push changes to GitHub
- [ ] Test complete flow on frontend
- [ ] Monitor logs for errors

---

## 🎯 Recommended Path

```
Step 1: Preparation (5 minutes)
→ Run ./setup-railway.sh
→ Get Discord CLIENT_SECRET

Step 2: Railway Deployment (5 minutes)
→ Read QUICK_DEPLOY.md
→ Create Railway project
→ Add environment variables
→ Generate domain

Step 3: Frontend Update (2 minutes)
→ Update landing-app.js with Railway URL
→ git commit & push

Step 4: Testing (5 minutes)
→ Test health endpoint
→ Test complete user flow
→ Check logs

Total Time: ~20 minutes
```

## 💡 Key Points

### Why Railway?

✅ **Easiest Setup** - GitHub integration, auto-detection  
✅ **Free Tier** - 500 hours/month, $5 credit  
✅ **Fast Deployment** - Live in 2-3 minutes  
✅ **Great DX** - Clean UI, good logs  
✅ **Auto HTTPS** - Free SSL certificates  

### Alternative: Render

✅ **More Free Hours** - 750 hours/month  
✅ **Simple Setup** - Similar to Railway  
⚠️ **Spins Down** - After 15min inactivity (wakes on request)  

### Why Not Vercel?

Vercel is optimized for serverless/edge functions, not long-running Express servers. Railway/Render are better for your use case.

### Why Not Supabase?

Supabase is great for database + auth, but would require restructuring your backend. Stick with Railway/Render for now.

## 🔐 Security Notes

### Files to NEVER Commit

- ❌ `mint-keypair.txt` (generated by setup script)
- ❌ `security/*.json` (mint authority keypair)
- ❌ `security/*.pem` (MongoDB certificates)
- ❌ `.env` or `.env.*` (environment variables)

### Already Protected

- ✅ `.gitignore` includes all sensitive files
- ✅ `.railwayignore` excludes from deployment
- ✅ Setup script warns about security

## 🆘 Common Issues

### "solana-keygen: command not found"

**Fix:** Install Solana CLI:
```bash
sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/stable/install)"
```

### "Module not found" on Railway

**Fix:** Ensure `package.json` is in repository root (it is).

### "CORS policy" error

**Fix:** Already configured in `api/server.js` for GitHub Pages domain.

### "Cannot connect to MongoDB"

**Fix:** 
- Copy exact `MONGODB_URI` from your .env
- Check MongoDB Atlas network access
- Try without `MONGO_CERT_PATH` first

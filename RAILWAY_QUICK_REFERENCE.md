# 🚂 Railway Deployment - Quick Reference Card

## 🎯 Problem: Bot Not Online

**Root Cause:** Railway starts API server instead of Discord bot

**Quick Fix:**
1. Railway Dashboard → Settings → Start Command
2. Change to: `npm run start:bot-railway`
3. Add environment variables (see below)
4. Redeploy

## 🔑 Required Secrets (Minimum)

```bash
BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
CLIENT_ID=your_discord_client_id
```

**Get them here:**
- https://discord.com/developers/applications
- Your App → Bot → Token (BOT_TOKEN)
- Your App → OAuth2 → Client ID (CLIENT_ID)

---

## ✅ Success Indicators

**In Railway Logs:**
```
✅ BOT_TOKEN: ***xxxx
